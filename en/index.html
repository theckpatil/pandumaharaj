              &nbsp; &nbsp;Shri Pandurang Mahadu Patil, also known as <strong>"Pandu Maharaj"</strong> was born on April
              1, 1939, in the
              Bhadane family of Nagaon village in Dhule District . Despite humble beginnings, he started working as a farmer from a young
              age. Through relentless hard work and dedication, he faced the initial struggles of his life.
              <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;During his childhood, he was deeply influenced by spiritual surroundings both at home and
              in the community. Alongside his family, Maharaj engaged in agricultural work, contributing to his village.
              Despite their impoverished circumstances, he maintained steadfast faith in his beliefs and pursued
              spiritual practices.

              <h3 class="sub-head">✽ Spiritual Awakening ✽</span>
              </h3>
              &nbsp; &nbsp;One day while working in the fields, Maharaj had a divine vision of Guru Gorakhnath (one of
              the Navnaths). This encounter marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life. Accepting the teachings
              of the Navnaths, he guided his devotees on their spiritual path.

              <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the guidance of Guru Shri Sant Kashivishwanath Baba (Aurangabad institution),
              Maharaj gained spiritual knowledge and progressed in his spiritual practices. Following Kashivishwanath
              Baba's instructions, Maharaj and his companions tirelessly worked to build the Shri Guru Dattatreya (Ek
              Mukhi Datt) temple in Nagaon. This temple became a significant religious center for the village, hosting
              numerous spiritual programs and fostering spiritual growth among devotees.

              </h3>
              &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout his life, Maharaj dedicated much of his time to social service and spiritual
              activities. He guided many devotees and awakened their faith and devotion. Maharaj's unwavering efforts
              fostered unity and spiritual advancement among the people of Nagaon. He organized various religious
              programs in the village, which contributed to his popularity.

              <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Maharaj consistently promoted cooperation and unity among the villagers. He actively
              participated in various social and religious programs, fostering unity and solidarity. His efforts helped
              the people of Nagaon overcome differences and work together collaboratively.

              &nbsp; &nbsp;At the age of 80, on February 3, 2019, at approximately 6:45 AM, Maharaj attained
              Mahasamadhi. His samadhi is located on the upper side of the Shri Guru Dattatreya temple in Nagaon. The
              structure of the samadhi is aesthetically appealing, with a 6-feet long and 3-feet wide construction. The
              upper part houses a 2-feet statue of Shri Pandurang Maharaj and his padukas (footwear). The lower part
              accommodates the installation of Shri Maheshwar Aatmaling (Shivalinga) and Nandi. The construction of the
              samadhi is delicate and artistic, making it an attractive site.
